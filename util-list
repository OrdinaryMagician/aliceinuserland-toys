This is a list of all the possible utils I can think of. I'll be filling it up every once in a while.

1000monkeys - filler generator using an external dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words)
beeper - a simple program to send tones to the pc speaker, can read sequences from stdin in the format <freq>,<duration>, each note separated by a newline
bbox - a bouncing box screensaver
stars - starfield screensaver
rustle - a bland unfunny meme simulator, reads words ending in 'ed' and 'ies' from /usr/share/dict/words
choose - let this pseudorandom program make decisions for you. Just separate choices with the word 'or'
